### about  
  
This repository contains code and antibody sequence data from our Cell manuscript: "Tailored immunogens direct affinity maturation toward HIV neutralizing antibodies."
  
  
### getting started  
  
If you're new to Python, a great first step is to install the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), which includes pip as well as a ton of useful scientific Python packages. Working with GitHub repositories is also much easier if you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.  
  
After you've installed git and Anaconda, you need to clone this repository and install some additional Python dependencies:  
  `git clone https://github.com/briney/VRC01gH-GT3/`  
  `cd VRC01gH-GT3`  
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
  
Now all that's left to do is start Jupyter Notebook, which will open a browser window:  
`jupyter notebook`  
  
Clicking on `figure_code.ipynb` will open a new browser window with the code used to generate most of the panels in Figure 3. All you need to do to run a block of code is to click on the code block and press `Shift-Enter`. It's important to note that some blocks of code depend on the results of previous blocks, so running the blocks in order is best.
